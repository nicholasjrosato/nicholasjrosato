- My name is Nick Rosato, I am a writing professional with specialized experience in the construction industry writing client-facing explanatory technical proposals. 
- My mission on GitHub is to use my writing skills to contribute to open source software, improving the quality, readability, and comprehensiveness of its developer and client facing documentation.
- My current free-time-personal-development efforts are focused on learning the basics of web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) so that I can hone a fundamental understanding of online publishing technologies, like WordPress, DITA XML, and Markdown.
